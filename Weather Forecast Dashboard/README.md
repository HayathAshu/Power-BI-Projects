# 🌦️ Weather Forecast Dashboard – Power BI

This repository contains an interactive **Weather Forecast Dashboard** built using **:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}**, where real-time and historical weather data is fetched directly from the **:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}** web service.

This project demonstrates API integration inside Power BI, data transformation, and the creation of visually rich weather analytics.

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Weather Forecast Dashboard** visualizes live and forecasted weather conditions sourced from WeatherAPI.  
Using Power BI, the data was connected through an API URL provided by WeatherAPI, modeled, and transformed to produce insightful charts, KPIs, and metrics such as:

- Current Temperature  
- Humidity, Wind Speed & Pressure  
- Air Quality Index (AQI)  
- Hourly & Daily Weather Forecast  
- Sunrise / Sunset Times  
- Weather Condition Trends  
- Real-time dynamic updates  

This dashboard is ideal for learning API connections, Power BI modeling, and visualization techniques.

## 🌐 Data Source

Weather data is fetched from:  
**:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}** (https://weatherapi.com/)  

The API provides data through an HTTP endpoint, including:  
- Current weather  
- 24-hour forecast  
- Multi-day forecast  
- Location metadata  
- Weather conditions & descriptions  

Data was imported into Power BI using the API key + endpoint URL.
